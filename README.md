# My Personal Webblog

Welcome to my personal weblog! 📝

This blog is a space where I plan on sharing my thoughts, tutorials, and project. It's built entirely from scratch using **Laravel**, a powerful PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and developer-friendly tools.

## 🔧 Built With

- **Laravel**: The core of my blog, handling everything from routing and controllers to Eloquent ORM and Blade templates.
- **PHP**: The language powering the back-end logic and dynamic content generation.
- **MySQL**: Used for storing blog posts, comments, user data, and more.
- **Vanilla CSS**: .

## 🛠️ Why Laravel?

Laravel provides a great balance between simplicity and power. It allowed me to:

- Rapidly build out features using artisan commands
- Keep my code organized using MVC architecture
- Integrate middleware and authentication easily
- Leverage Eloquent ORM for interacting with the database

## 📈 What’s Next?

I'm continuously adding new features and refining the blog. Future updates may include:

- Fully functional comment system
- Better optimization for mobile devices
